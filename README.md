Deep learning methods have shown promise in many engineering fields. 
A multi-component convolutional neural network is proposed for the 
surface inspection based on the feature information in different 
color spaces in this paper. The wavelet entropy is used to represent 
the information of different components to remove redundant components 
and extract effective feature information. Meanwhile, an attention 
mechanism is developed to capture medium-long distance features, 
enhance their semantic expression ability, and eliminate the influence 
that the traditional convolution cannot fuse context information into 
local features. The best network structure is determined by evaluating 
the layer depth of the basic model and convolution kernel size. A 
multi-component network model is constructed based on the formed structure 
to improve the ability of distinguishing different color difference features.

In view of the fact that our paper is still under review and has been revised, 
according to the review comments, I can't disclose the complete code data, 
because some of them involve the following work, so we plan to wait for the paper 
to be accepted, and then I will fully disclose our code data. I believe you will 
also understand us, and enjoy the subscription. I will disclose the data as soon 
as the paper is accepted.
